/**
 * CAS: Configuration and Attestation Service.
 * It handles configurations and secret provisioning: a user uploads secrets
 * and configuration infos for a specific service to the CAS.
 * When a service wants to access those secrets, it sends a quote with its MREnclave.
 * The CAS attests the quote through Intel Attestation Service and sends the secrets
 * if the MREnclave is as expected.
 * 
 * MREnclave: an enclave identifier, created by hashing all its
 * code. It guarantees that a code behaves exactly as expected.
